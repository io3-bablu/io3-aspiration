          A. There are 5 rules to avoid Coronavirus. You should follow and apply
          this to your loved ones <br />
          during the trip.
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Always wear a mask in a crowded place.</li>
          <li>
            Wash your hands from both sides with good quality handwash certified
            by medical professionals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carry a sanitizer with you after touching anything then sanitize
            your hands properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain at least one-meter distance with everybody if not possible
            then leave that place immediately and search for the safe place.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you and your tripmates like friends, or a family member feel
            something awkward then immediately call for medical help and get
            checked.

            places it will be very hard to reach for medical help.

<h1>The Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Telegraph lead on claims that Boris Johnson was aware of allegations about Chris Pincher's sexual conduct before he gave him the job of deputy chief whip.</h1>
<p> According to the Telegraph, another senior whip at the time, Craig Whittaker, resigned in protest over the appointment.

Downing Street has said it was not aware of any specific claims before the appointment was made.

The Mail says there is growing concern in Downing Street that the scandal could lead to a by-election in Mr Pincher's Tamworth constituency.

The paper says many Tory MPs are applying intense pressure for him to be stripped of his seat. </p>

<p> <b> <u> A report in the Sunday Mirror says </u> </b> the <mark> prime minister </mark> was warned twice of sexual misconduct claims - first by his MPs and then by MPs' staffers.

One of the men accusing Mr Pincher of touching him inappropriately on Wednesday <b> <u>has spoken to the Sunday Times.</u></b>

He said the incident left him <i> "furious" and "shell-shocked".</i>

The alleged victim also said he was even more angry about the way Downing Street dealt with the situation.</p>
